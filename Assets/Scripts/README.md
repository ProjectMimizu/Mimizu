Sorry for the disorganized-ness, will clean it up soon:

  Tasks:
   * Figure out the LevelGenerator 3D terrain generator code
   * Clean up player code: `OldMan2D.cs` (this is the 2D terrain version, probably will switch back to `OldMan` for 3D version if the 3D terrain code works)
   * Clean up weapons code, create a modular weapons class code that all guns can be in instead of a separate script for each gun
